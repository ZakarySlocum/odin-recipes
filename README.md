# odin-recipes

Iteration 0.1 - 11/28/2023

In this project, I learned and demonstrated the skills of HTML. This includes understanding HTML structure, element types, attributes to elements, making links work, and displaying images. 

I also demonstrated the use of git through the terminal with commands. This includes understanding how to add/remove files on staging, how to commit changes, view the log of commits, check the status of the repo (tracked or untracked files, modified files, staged or unstaged files), and to push changes to the repo. 

Enjoy the Buffalo Recipes! :)
